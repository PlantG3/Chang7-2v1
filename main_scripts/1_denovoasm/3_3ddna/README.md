## 3d-dna
3d-dna (version:180922) was used for scaffolding. The parameters of "-r 0 -q 10" were specified for " run-asm-pipeline.sh". The 3d-dna scaffolding result was manually examined in Juicebox (version 1.11.08) for corrections. Sscaffolds and contigs were further filtered to remove sequences less than 25 kb. The remaining sequences were then merged with potential mitochondrion and chloroplast sequences with at least 25 kb, resulting in the Chang7-2 reference genome version 1 (Ch7-2v1).
